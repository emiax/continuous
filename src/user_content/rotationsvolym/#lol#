Hi Timo!
We're a group of three students that took your course in Scientific Visualization earlier this year. For the next semester, we're joining a course in Advanced Flow Simulations and Visualization (TN1008).
In preperation for this course we are wondering if we could meet and discuss some methods for visualizing symbolically defined vector fields.

Do you have time for a short meeting some time this week?

Looking forward to you response, 
Karl Johan Krantz
